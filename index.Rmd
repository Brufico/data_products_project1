The data
=========

Obtaining the data
------------------
First we get and read the data (source: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/carte-des-points-d-accueil-police-a-paris-idf/)

A description of the types of police departments (SAIP, BDEP) can be found at : https://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/Vous-aider/Accueil-du-public/Accueil-du-public/Radioscopie-d-un-commissariat

Preparing the data
------------------
Columns 1 to 4 have been added to the data in order to better code some of the other columns. Original column 12 has been expanded into the `latitude` and `longitude` columns, and deleted.


```{r data, echo = FALSE}
# Reading the data
datadir <- "data"
fname <- "PoliceParis2.csv"
fpath <- file.path(datadir, fname)

df <- read.table(fpath, 
                 sep = ";", 
                 quote = "",
                 comment.char = "",
                 header = TRUE, 
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# names(df)
# get rid of superfluous columns (latitude and
# longitude have already been extracted from these columns)
df <- df[ , -(12:15)]
```

Columns of the dataframe:

```{r showdata, echo = FALSE}
# montrer les variables de la base
cnames <- colnames(df)
# add names
names(cnames) <- as.character(1:length(cnames))
# print nicely
knitr::kable(t(cnames))
```


Description of the variables:
-----------------------------

* `r cnames[1:3]` - 1 if the correspondng type of department exists there, else 0
* `r cnames[4]` - 1 if the building is accessible to people with disabiities 
* `r cnames[5]` - 1 if open 24/7, else 0
* `r cnames[6]` - arrondissement (code number of the administrative area)
* `r cnames[7]` - list of the departments at this address
* `r cnames[8]` - Street address
* `r cnames[9]` - Phone number
* `r cnames[10]` - Opening hours
* `r cnames[11]` - Original accessibility description
* `r cnames[12:13]` - Latitude, Longitude


The map
========


```{r map, echo = FALSE, fig.pos= "center", fig.cap="Map of the Police departments in Paris"}

# coding the service as the marker color: 
#       * Commissariat central = red
#       * SAIP or BDEP = orange
#       * other = white
getMarkerColor <- function(dframe) {
        sapply(1:nrow(dframe),
               function(i) {
                       if(dframe$Commissariat.central[i] == 1) {
                               "red"
                       } else if (dframe$SAIP[i] == 1 | dframe$BDEP[i] == 1) {
                               "orange"
                       } else {
                               "white"
                       }
               }
        )
}

# Completing this code by displaying the icon in blue if the
# service is SAIP
getIconColor <- function(dframe) {
        ifelse(dframe$SAIP == 1, "blue", "black")
}

# icon should be a wheelchair if the service is accessible
# to handicapped people (else a "user") (in the `fa` icon library)
getIcon <- function(dframe) {
        ifelse(dframe$acces == 1, "wheelchair", "user")
}

# Marker shape: Square if service is open 7/7 h24
getMarkerShape <- function(dframe) {
        ifelse(dframe$h24 == 1, TRUE, FALSE)
}

# Popup : should be the service description, address, phone, opening hours
getPopup <- function(dframe) {
        sapply(1:nrow(dframe),
               function(i) {
                       dfrow <- dframe[i, ]
                       paste(c(dfrow$service,
                               dfrow$adresse,
                               paste0("Paris ", dfrow$ardt),
                               dfrow$telephone,
                               paste0("Ouverture: ", dfrow$horaires) ),
                             collapse = "<br>") 
               }
        )
}

# assemble the 'icons' argument
icons <- awesomeIcons(
        icon = getIcon(df),
        iconColor = getIconColor(df),
        library = 'fa',
        markerColor = getMarkerColor(df),
        squareMarker = getMarkerShape(df)
)

# Make the map
leaflet(df #, height = "15cm", width = "20cm"
        ) %>% 
        addTiles() %>%
        addAwesomeMarkers(~long, ~lat, 
                          icon=icons, 
                          popup = getPopup(df),
                          label = ~service) %>%
        addLegend(title = "Police departments",
                  labels = c("Commissariat Central",
                             "SAIP ou BDEP",
                             "Other"), 
                  colors = c("red", "orange", "white"))
```

### Reading the map:
* the colours indicate the type of office:
    * Commissariat central: red marker
    * SAIP: orange marker, blue icon,
    * BDEP: orange marker
    * other: white marker
* Opening hours: a square marker has been used for the offices which are permanently open. It turns out that the central police stations are the only permanently open services.
* Accessibility : if a service has been made accessible to to people with disabilities, the icon of that service is a wheelchair <i class="fa fa-wheelchair" aria-hidden="true"></i>.

* Interactive features:
    * zoom on the map using your mouse
    * hover above a marker to identify the department name
    * click on a marker to get a full description
